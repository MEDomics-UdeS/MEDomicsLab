# MEDomicsLab - Integrative Modeling of Heterogeneous Data in Medicine

During the Winter 2024 semester, the first Testing Phase of MEDomicsLab will take place. We would love to have you join the effort and provide feedback during this Testing Phase, prior to a first official release of MEDomicsLab! Our intent is to properly recognize all the participants of the Testing Phase when the first official release will come.

## Requirements to participate in the Testing Phase of MEDomicsLab

The participation in the Testing Phase will involve the use of data from the [MIMIC database](https://mimic.mit.edu/). We have already processed the MIMIC data for the purpose of the Testing Phase. To share this processed data with you, we need you to complete [the following](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/):
* Become a [credential user of MIMIC](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/)
* Complete the [CITI Course](https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/)
* Sign the following four Physionet data use agreements: (i) [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/); (ii) [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/); (iii) [MIMIC-IV-ED](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/); and (iv) [MIMIC-IV-Note](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/)
* Send us the 5 forms (CITI Course certification + 4 signed data use agreements) to <medomics.info@gmail.com>

This process related to accessing MIMIC data will take some time, but we assure you it will be worth it!
